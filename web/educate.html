<h2>Educate yourself</h2>

<p>If you haven't started your period yet, all of this probably sounds extremely intimidating! We understand. Sometimes, the amount of information you're given about your upcoming first period can be overwhelming, and sometimes it feels like there's this big secret that you know you're going to be part of, but no one has told you anything about it.</p>

<p>First, if you have a good relationship with a menstruating parent or adult, we encourage you to talk to them. Like so much else in life, periods vary from person to person, and some of those variances can be based on genetics. Maybe a grandparent had endometriosis, or a parent has PMDD. Those are important things to know. So, if you're comfortable with having those conversations, that's a great place to start.</p>

<p>If you trust your doctor, that's also a great place to start! If your doctor hasn't started to talk to you about what to expect from your first period, it's never a bad idea to ask. We know it can be super uncomfortable, but it's better to have the information you need and be a little bit embarrassed for a little while than to not have information and live in anxiety.</p>

<h3>The Basics</h3>

<p>If you have a uterus and ovaries, you have the capacity to become pregnant and give birth (though there are many other things that may prevent either of these, regardless of what reproductive organs you have). Humans with uteruses and ovaries can become pregnant once per menstrual cycle (once per period).</p>

<details open>
    <summary><strong>How long is one menstrual cycle (the end of one period to the beginning of the next)?</strong></summary>
    <p>Honestly, it can vary depending on you and your body! Some menstruators have what's called an irregular cycle, where their cycle length changes cycle to cycle. Some menstruators have conditions that can cause them to menstruate every two weeks, though that would be something you need to see your doctor about. But generally, a normal cycle - called a “regular” cycle - is roughly every 28 days. That means that from the end of one period to the beginning of another is about 28 days.</p>
</details>

<details open>
    <summary><strong>What's actually happening during my period?</strong></summary>
    <p>Short answer? Your body realizes it isn't pregnant, and needs to get rid of the unfertilized egg. Longer answer? The egg that your ovaries released about 10-14ish days ago wasn't fertilized by a sperm - which means that it won't attach to your uterine lining (the lining of your uterus) to potentially become a fetus. Your body recognizes that the egg hasn't been fertilized and now it needs to expel that egg, along with the tissue the uterus has been building as a way to cradle a possible fertilized egg. So, your uterus sheds its lining and the egg goes with it! This discharge is called your period, and exits your body through your vagina. A typical period takes about 5-7 days to complete, so that means that your body discharges that uterine lining for 5-7 days, though the rate of flow will vary in that time.</p>

    <summary><strong>That sounds kind of messy. How do I make sure that I keep clean during my period?</strong></summary>
    <p>First of all, let's just dispel one horrible rumor: periods aren't gross. They aren't dirty. They're honestly pretty amazing! Your body is doing exactly what it's meant to do, so don't let anyone tell you that you're dirty or gross during your period.

    That being said, it's also not exciting to think about sitting with uterine lining (aka, “period blood”) in your underwear for about a week. There are three main ways to catch menstrual discharge, and none of them are any better or worse than the other:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pads:</strong> The oldest menstrual technology! Essentially, a pad is like a very small diaper that you stick in your underwear to soak up the menstrual discharge. Then, when your pad is full, you replace it. Remember to never flush a pad! Always dispose of it in the trash next to the toilet (the little metal box, if you're in a public restroom). Menstrual underwear (period panties) are similar to pads in their basic mechanics, but menstrual underwear is reusable! Be sure to read the directions before you wear your first pair, though!</li>
        <li><strong>Tampons:</strong> Tampons are compact, elongated cotton balls that you insert into your vagina to catch menstrual discharge before it leaves your body. Tampons can come with applicators (tubes to help you insert them) or not. You remove a tampon by pulling on a string that trails outside your vagina when your tampon is inserted. While they can be very practical (no diaper feeling, like with pads), there are a few really important things to know about tampons.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>They may not be the best bet for your first period. Tampons can feel really weird to insert at first, and it can definitely take some practice to get used to inserting a tampon. As weird as it may sound, be sure you practice inserting and removing a tampon! Read the instructions on the information insert inside your tampon box.</li>
            <li>You must change your tampon every 4-6 hours for medical reasons. If you leave your tampon in too long, you run the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome, which is a very serious medical condition. There's no need to panic, though! Just be sure that you change your tampon regularly!</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Menstrual cups:</strong> These are also called Diva cups after the most-commonly-known brand. Similar to tampons, menstrual cups are inserted into the vagina, but unlike tampons, they are reusable. A menstrual cup has a little tail on it - again, sort of like a tampon - that you use to remove it. You then dump its contents (it is, after all, a cup!) into the toilet and flush, just like with urine. Like tampons, menstrual cups have a few important things to know:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Like tampons, be sure to remove and dump the contents of your menstrual cup regularly - at least every 12 hours. Always be sure to wash your hands with soap and water before removing your cup! It can take some getting used to to use a menstrual cup as well, so make sure you practice inserting and removing it a few times.</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep your menstrual cup clean by washing it in between insertions with a mild, unscented, oil-free soap. Otherwise, bacteria can build up and cause all kinds of problems.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <summary><strong>But what about when I'm sleeping?!</strong></summary>

    <p>Wear a pad, period panties, or use a menstrual cup when you're sleeping, as that's safer than sleeping for more than 6 hours with a tampon in!</p>

    <summary><strong>What exactly is PMS?</strong></summary>

    <p>PMS, or premenstrual syndrome, describes the days leading up to your period when your body's hormones are getting ready for your period to start. PMS can typically be classified by feeling really sad, or weepy, or moody. You can also feel bloated and crampy, and your breasts may be sore. It's also normal to feel tired and just generally not awesome. PMS is completely normal, but if you're experiencing really substantial mood swings, extreme bouts of sadness, or other things, please tell a trusted adult. PMDD - premenstrual dysphoric disorder (basically really intense PMS) is a real thing and your doctor may be able to help you!</p>
</details>

<details open>
    <summary><strong>I hear a lot of people talking - and I've seen some stuff on TikTok - about period cramps being really bad…is that true?</strong></summary>
    <p>Again, every person is different, but yes. Period cramps are to be expected, but some menstruators experience extremely painful cramps, which is not normal (please talk to your doctor if you're experiencing intense pain during your period!). Basically, period cramps feel like a very achy stomach ache, but in your pelvic area (between your hip bones). They can cause backaches and jelly legs as well if they get really bad. When that happens, you can wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and hold it on your pelvic area, or you can take an over-the-counter pain relief (ibuprofen or naproxen). Be sure to talk to a trusted adult before taking any medication on your own, and always read the directions on the bottle before you take anything.</p>

    <summary><strong>Oh my gosh! Why can periods be painful?!</strong></summary>

    <p>Your uterus is a muscular organ that can expand and contract - “contract” being the word we're focusing on here. As it tries to expel its lining during your period, it will contract, which means it's working pretty hard and that can definitely be uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Again, extremely painful periods are not normal. If your period cramps hurt so bad that they prevent you from doing regular day-to-day things, talk to a trusted adult and your doctor. There are medical conditions, such as endometriosis, which can make periods extremely painful, and it's important to know if you're experiencing something like that so that you can take care of your health and body.</p>
</details>

<details open>
    <summary><strong>What else can I expect from my period?</strong></summary>

    <p>Again, it's so important to remember that every menstruating body is different, so there is no one answer to this question. However, many menstruators experience bloating, breakouts, cramping, moodiness, hunger cravings (or, conversely, loss of appetite), and feelings of exhaustion. These things are all normal and related to your body's hormones, and nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about! Remember that your body is doing a pretty incredible thing during your period.</p>
</details>

<details open>
    <summary><strong>So why would I want to track my period?</strong></summary>

    <p>There are a lot of reasons why a menstruator may want to track their period. For those who are trying to get pregnant, the window of time when they can get pregnant depends upon their menstrual cycle. On the other hand, for those who are sexually active but looking to prevent pregnancy, knowing that their period is late is often times the first indication of potential pregnancy (the egg hasn't been expelled because it was fertilized and has now embedded itself into the uterine lining to potentially become a fetus).</p>

    <p>For those whose periods are irregular, it can be helpful to figure out if there's some sort of pattern. This is especially applicable for you! Those who have only just started menstruating can have very irregular periods while their bodies are getting used to the hormonal changes it's undergoing.</p>

    <p>As you begin your period, remember that it is completely normal to ask questions and be curious. Your body is changing, and it's no small change! You, period, is here to help you navigate the world of menstruation and take charge of your body and reproductive health. If you have any questions, check out the links from trusted sources below! And if you have a specific question that you don't see answered here, check out our discussion forum! No matter what you're experiencing or what questions you have, we promise you're not the only menstruating young person to have those experiences or questions, and we're here for YOU. Period.</p>
